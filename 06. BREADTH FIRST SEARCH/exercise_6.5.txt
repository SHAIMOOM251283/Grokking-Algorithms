A—Tree 
B—Not a tree
C—Tree

A tree is always a graph, but a graph may or may not be a tree.

    Tree:
        In a tree, each node (except the root node) has exactly one parent. 
        In the provided tree, node 1 is the root, nodes 2 and 3 are its children, and nodes 4 and 5 are children of node 2.
        There are no cycles in a tree. 
        A cycle occurs when you can traverse through edges and return to the same node without repeating any edges. 
        In the provided tree, there are no cycles. You cannot start at any node and return to it without repeating edges.
        Hence, the tree satisfies the definition of a graph (a collection of nodes connected by edges) 
        while also adhering to the specific constraints of a tree (no cycles, exactly one parent per node).

    Graph that is not a Tree:
        The graph provided has the same nodes as the tree, but it has an additional edge between nodes 2 and 3, 
        creating a cycle (the path 2-1-3-2 forms a cycle).
        In this graph, node 2 has two neighbors: nodes 1 and 3. 
        This violates the condition of a tree where each node (except the root) should have exactly one parent.
        Additionally, the presence of a cycle violates the tree property where there should be no cycles.
        Therefore, while the graph shares the basic structure of a tree (nodes connected by edges), 
        it does not satisfy the specific criteria for a tree due to the presence of cycles and nodes with multiple parents.

In simple terms, the tree is a type of graph where each node has a single parent (except the root) and there are no loops or cycles. 
On the other hand, the provided graph does not meet these conditions, as it contains cycles and nodes with multiple parents, 
making it not a tree but still a graph.
