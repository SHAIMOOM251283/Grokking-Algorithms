For a breadth-first algorithm, you need to ensure that the dependencies are respected. 
In this case, "Eat Breakfast" depends on "Brush Teeth". Here's an analysis of each list:

List 1:

    Wake up
    Shower
    Eat Breakfast (Depends on Brush Teeth)
    Brush Teeth

This list is invalid because "Eat Breakfast" comes before "Brush Teeth", which violates the dependency.

List 2:

    Wake up
    Brush Teeth
    Eat Breakfast (Depends on Brush Teeth)
    Shower

This list is valid because "Brush Teeth" comes before "Eat Breakfast", satisfying the dependency.

List 3:

    Shower
    Wake up
    Brush Teeth
    Eat Breakfast (Depends on Brush Teeth)

This list is invalid because "Wake up" comes before "Shower", which is unusual and might not align with a typical morning routine. 
Additionally, "Eat Breakfast" comes after "Brush Teeth" as required.

So, List 2 is the only valid list according to the dependency rule.
