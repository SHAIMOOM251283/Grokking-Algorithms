Random Access:

    Arrays:
        Random access refers to the ability to directly access any element in the data structure using its index or position.
        Arrays provide constant-time random access, O(1), because elements are stored in contiguous memory, 
        and the index can be used to compute the memory address directly.
        Example: array[3] gives you direct access to the 4th element in the array.

    Lists (Linked Lists):
        Random access is not efficient in linked lists. To access an element at a specific position, 
        you must traverse the list from the beginning (or end) until you reach the desired node.
        The time complexity for random access in linked lists is O(n), where n is the position of the element being accessed.

Sequential Access:

    Arrays:
        Sequential access involves visiting each element in order, one after the other.
        Arrays support efficient sequential access due to their contiguous memory layout. 
        Iterating through elements sequentially has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

    Lists (Linked Lists):
        Linked lists are well-suited for sequential access. You can traverse the list from the head to the tail or vice versa efficiently.
        Sequential access in linked lists also has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

Summary:

    Arrays provide efficient random access (O(1)) but have O(n) time complexity for sequential access in terms of iteration.
    Linked lists have O(n) time complexity for both random and sequential access because traversing the list is required in both cases.
    The choice between arrays and linked lists depends on the specific access patterns and operations required by the application. 
    Arrays are preferable for scenarios with frequent random access, 
    while linked lists may be more suitable for scenarios with frequent insertions or deletions.
