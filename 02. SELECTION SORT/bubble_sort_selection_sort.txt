The two algorithms, Bubble Sort and Selection Sort, are both comparison-based sorting algorithms, 
but they differ in their approach and performance characteristics.
Bubble Sort:

Approach:

    Bubble Sort works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
    The algorithm "bubbles" the largest unsorted element to its correct position in each pass.

Algorithm Steps:

    Iterate through the list multiple times (outer loop).
    In each pass, compare adjacent elements and swap if needed (inner loop).
    Repeat until the entire list is sorted.

Time Complexity:

    The worst-case time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2).
    In each pass, the algorithm makes comparisons and swaps, 
    leading to a total of approximately n * (n-1) / 2 comparisons and swaps in the worst case.

Selection Sort:

Approach:

    Selection Sort works by dividing the list into a sorted and an unsorted portion.
    In each iteration, it finds the smallest (or largest) element in the unsorted portion 
    and swaps it with the first element in the unsorted portion.

Algorithm Steps:

    Maintain a sorted and an unsorted portion of the list.
    In each iteration, find the smallest element in the unsorted portion.
    Swap the smallest element with the first element in the unsorted portion.
    Move the boundary between sorted and unsorted portions.

Time Complexity:

    The worst-case time complexity of Selection Sort is O(n^2).
    In each iteration, it performs a linear search for the smallest element in the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first element.

Key Differences:

    Comparison Strategy:
        Bubble Sort compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
        Selection Sort finds the smallest (or largest) element in the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first element.

    Number of Comparisons:
        Bubble Sort compares every pair of elements in each pass.
        Selection Sort performs a linear search for the smallest element in each iteration.

    Stability:
        Both Bubble Sort and Selection Sort are not stable, meaning that the relative order of equal elements may change.

    Adaptability:
        Neither algorithm is adaptive, meaning that their performance does not improve if the list is partially sorted.

In summary, both Bubble Sort and Selection Sort have O(n^2) time complexities in the worst case, 
but they differ in their specific approaches to sorting elements. Both algorithms are generally not recommended for large datasets, 
and more efficient algorithms like quicksort or mergesort are often preferred.
