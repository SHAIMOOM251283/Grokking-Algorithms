Tail-Recursive Function:

def factorial(n, accumulator=1):
    if n == 0:
        return accumulator
    else:
        return factorial(n - 1, accumulator * n)

Structure: This implementation uses a helper function factorial, which takes an additional parameter accumulator to 
accumulate the factorial result. 
The recursive call factorial(n - 1, accumulator * n) is in the tail position, and no additional computation is performed 
after the recursive call.

Efficiency: This function is tail-recursive, making it potentially more memory-efficient 
and eligible for tail call optimization by compilers or interpreters.

Non-Tail-Recursive Function:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        result = n * factorial(n - 1)
        return result

Structure: This implementation directly calculates the factorial of n without using an accumulator. 
The recursive call factorial(n - 1) is made, and then the result is multiplied by n to obtain the factorial of n.

Efficiency: This function is not tail-recursive because the recursive call is followed by additional computation (multiplication by n) 
before returning the result. 
As a result, it may consume more memory and is less likely to be optimized for tail calls by compilers or interpreters.

In summary, the tail-recursive function uses an accumulator to accumulate the factorial result 
and ensures that the recursive call is in the tail position, 
potentially leading to better memory efficiency and optimization by compilers. 
On the other hand, the non-tail-recursive function directly calculates the factorial without using an accumulator, 
which may result in less memory efficiency and optimization opportunities.
