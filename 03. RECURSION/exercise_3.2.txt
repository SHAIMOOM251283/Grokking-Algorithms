When a recursive function runs forever, it keeps making recursive calls indefinitely 
without ever reaching a base case that would terminate the recursion. 
As a result, the call stack grows indefinitely, consuming more and more memory until the available memory is exhausted. 

This situation is commonly known as "infinite recursion" or "infinite loop."

Here's what happens to the stack when a recursive function runs forever:

    Call Stack Growth: Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack. 
    As the function continues to call itself recursively, more and more stack frames are added to the call stack, causing it to grow larger.

    Memory Consumption: With each additional stack frame, more memory is allocated to the call stack. 
    Since there is no termination condition to stop the recursion, this process continues indefinitely, consuming more and more memory.

    Stack Overflow: Eventually, the call stack reaches its maximum size, determined by factors such as the available memory and system settings. 
    When the call stack exceeds this maximum size, a stack overflow occurs. This results in a runtime error or exception, 
    and the program typically terminates abruptly.

    Program Crash: In some cases, the operating system may detect the stack overflow 
    and terminate the program to prevent it from consuming excessive resources. 
    This results in the program crashing or being forcibly terminated.

In summary, when a recursive function runs forever, it leads to an infinite growth of the call stack, 
consuming more memory until a stack overflow occurs or the program is terminated due to excessive resource usage. 
It's essential to ensure that recursive functions have proper termination conditions to prevent infinite recursion and stack overflow errors.
