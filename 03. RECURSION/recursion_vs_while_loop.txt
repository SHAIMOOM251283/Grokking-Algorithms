Using a call stack and recursion can sometimes offer advantages over using a while loop, 
depending on the problem and the structure of the algorithm. 

Here are some reasons why using a call stack might be more convenient:
    Clarity and readability: Recursion can often lead to more concise and readable code, 
    especially for problems that involve repetitive or nested operations. Recursive solutions can closely mirror the problem's definition 
    or mathematical formulation, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

    Ease of implementation: In some cases, translating a problem into a recursive solution is more straightforward 
    than writing an iterative solution using a while loop. 
    This is particularly true for problems that naturally lend themselves to recursive thinking, 
    such as tree traversal, backtracking, and certain mathematical computations like factorial or Fibonacci sequence generation.

    Handling nested or hierarchical structures: Recursion is well-suited for problems involving nested or hierarchical data structures, 
    such as trees or graphs. Recursive functions can traverse these structures naturally, without the need for complex iteration logic. 
    This simplifies the code and often leads to more efficient solutions.

    Reducing code duplication: Recursive functions can encapsulate repetitive patterns or computations, reducing the need for duplicated code. 
    This can lead to more modular and maintainable codebases, as common operations are abstracted into reusable functions.

    Facilitating problem decomposition: Recursion allows complex problems to be decomposed into smaller, more manageable subproblems. 
    Each recursive call focuses on solving a smaller instance of the problem, 
    leading to a divide-and-conquer approach that can simplify the overall problem-solving process.

However, it's essential to note that recursion also has its limitations and drawbacks. 
Recursion can lead to stack overflow errors if the depth of recursion becomes too large, 
and recursive solutions may not always be the most efficient or intuitive approach for every problem. 
Additionally, not all problems can be easily solved using recursion, and in some cases, 
an iterative solution using a while loop may be more appropriate. It's essential to consider the trade-offs 
and constraints of both approaches when choosing between recursion and iteration.
