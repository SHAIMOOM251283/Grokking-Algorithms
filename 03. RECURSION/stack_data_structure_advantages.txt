Stack Data Structure: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. 
It means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. 
Think of it as a pile of items where you can only add or remove items from the top.

Automatic Management: When you use a stack data structure, you don't need to manually manage the storage and retrieval of data elements. 
The stack abstracts away the details of managing the elements, providing simple operations like push (to add an item) 
and pop (to remove an item). These operations automatically handle the placement and removal of elements according to the LIFO principle.

Convenience: Because the stack handles the management of data for you, 
it simplifies the process of working with collections of data in your program. 
You don't need to worry about the specific memory locations or the order in which elements are stored. 
Instead, you can focus on the high-level logic of your algorithm or program.

Ease of Use: Using a stack allows you to write cleaner and more concise code. 
You can rely on the stack to maintain the correct order of elements, rather than implementing complex data management logic yourself. 
This leads to code that is easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

Reduced Error-Prone Code: Manual management of data structures, especially complex ones like stacks, can lead to errors such as memory leaks, 
dangling pointers, or incorrect ordering of elements. Using a stack abstracts away these low-level concerns, 
reducing the likelihood of such errors.

In summary, using a stack data structure provides convenience and abstraction, 
allowing you to focus on the higher-level logic of your program without getting bogged down in low-level data management details. 
The stack takes care of managing the data for you, making your code cleaner, more readable, and less error-prone.

Using the stack is convenient because you don’t have to keep track of a pile of items yourself—the stack does it for you.
