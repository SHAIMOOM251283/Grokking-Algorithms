    The greet("maggie") function is called first.
    Inside greet("maggie"), it calls the greet2("maggie") function.
    At this point, the execution of greet("maggie") is suspended, waiting for the greet2("maggie") function to complete.
    The current function call is the greet2("maggie") function.
    After greet2("maggie") completes, the program will return to where it left off in the greet("maggie") function, 
    allowing it to resume execution.
