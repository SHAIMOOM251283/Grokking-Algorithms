Yes, finding the largest clique in a set of people is indeed an NP-complete problem. 
It falls under the class of problems known as NP-complete because it is at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP 
and can be transformed into any other NP-complete problem in polynomial time.

In this context, determining whether a clique of a certain size exists in a graph (where people are represented as nodes 
and relationships as edges) can be done in polynomial time. However, finding the largest clique, which means finding the maximum-size clique, 
is NP-complete because it requires checking all possible subsets of nodes to determine if they form a clique, 
which grows exponentially with the size of the graph.

Therefore, like many other combinatorial optimization problems, finding the largest clique is NP-complete.
