A greedy strategy for maximizing the space in each truck when packing boxes for shipping could involve sorting the boxes by size 
and then packing them into the truck one by one, 
starting with the largest box that can fit and continuing with the next largest box that fits until there is no space left. 

Here's a step-by-step outline of the greedy strategy:

    Sort the boxes in descending order of size.
    Initialize an empty truck.
    Iterate through the sorted list of boxes:
    a. If the current box fits into the remaining space in the truck, pack it into the truck.
    b. If the current box does not fit, move to the next box.
    Continue until all boxes have been considered or there is no space left in the truck.

This strategy prioritizes larger boxes, maximizing the use of available space in each truck. 
However, it's important to note that this greedy strategy may not always provide the optimal solution. 
There might be cases where a different combination of smaller boxes could fit more efficiently into the truck, 
even though individually they are smaller than the larger boxes chosen by the greedy approach.

To determine whether the greedy strategy gives the optimal solution, you would need to compare the result obtained with other approaches, 
such as dynamic programming or backtracking, which consider all possible combinations of boxes to find the optimal solution. 
Additionally, the efficiency and practicality of these alternative approaches should also be considered, 
as they might not be suitable for large numbers of boxes due to their computational complexity.
