    Quicksort:
        Quicksort is not a greedy algorithm.
        Quicksort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by partitioning an array into two sub-arrays, 
        then recursively sorting each sub-array.
        Quicksort does not make locally optimal choices like greedy algorithms; 
        instead, it uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to efficiently sort the input array.

    Breadth-first search (BFS):
        Breadth-first search is not a greedy algorithm.
        BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbors of a node before moving on to the next level of nodes.
        BFS systematically explores all possible paths in a graph to find the shortest path from a start node to all other reachable nodes.
        Unlike greedy algorithms, BFS does not make locally optimal choices; it explores all possible options in a systematic manner.

    Dijkstra's algorithm:
        Dijkstra's algorithm is not a greedy algorithm.
        Dijkstra's algorithm is a shortest path algorithm used to find the shortest path from a single source node 
        to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
        Dijkstra's algorithm iteratively selects the node with the smallest tentative distance from the source 
        and updates the distances of its neighbors.
        Although Dijkstra's algorithm involves making locally optimal choices (selecting the node with the smallest tentative distance), 
        it does not always select the globally optimal path at each step, so it is not strictly a greedy algorithm.

In summary, none of these algorithms (Quicksort, Breadth-first search, and Dijkstra's algorithm) are classified as greedy algorithms. 
They each have their own unique strategies for solving specific types of problems.
