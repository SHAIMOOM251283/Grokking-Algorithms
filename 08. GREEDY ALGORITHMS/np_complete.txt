The term "NP-complete" refers to a class of problems in computational complexity theory.

    NP: NP stands for "nondeterministic polynomial time." A decision problem is in the class NP if, given a solution, 
    it can be verified as correct in polynomial time. In other words, if someone claims to have a solution to an NP problem, 
    you can quickly check whether the solution is correct or not.

    NP-Completeness: A problem is NP-complete if it belongs to the class NP, and it is at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. 
    More formally, a problem is NP-complete if every problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time.

Here's what that means practically:

    If you have an algorithm to solve an NP-complete problem in polynomial time, you can use it to solve any problem in NP in polynomial time. 
    This is because an NP-complete problem is essentially as hard as any problem in NP.
    If you could solve any NP-complete problem efficiently (in polynomial time), 
    you would have effectively solved all problems in NP efficiently, which would imply P = NP. 
    However, whether P equals NP is one of the most famous unsolved problems in computer science.
    It's important to note that just because a problem is NP-complete does not mean it's impossible to solve. 
    It means that no one has yet found an algorithm that can solve all instances of the problem efficiently in the worst case.

In the context of the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) and the set covering problem, 
both are NP-complete because they are decision problems (i.e., they require a yes/no answer), 
and they have been proven to be at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. 
For example, in TSP, given a set of cities and distances between them, 
the problem is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. 
Similarly, in the set covering problem, given a set of subsets of a universal set, 
the problem is to find the smallest collection of subsets that covers the entire universal set. 
Both problems are notoriously difficult to solve optimally in the general case.

Determining whether a problem is NP-complete involves two steps:

    Verify that the problem is in NP: This means that given a potential solution to the problem, 
    you can verify its correctness in polynomial time. In other words, if someone claims to have a solution, 
    you can efficiently check whether the solution is correct.

    Show that the problem is NP-hard: This involves demonstrating that any problem in NP can be reduced to your problem in polynomial time. 
    In simpler terms, it means that your problem is at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP.

Once both steps are completed, you can conclude that the problem is NP-complete. 
This classification implies that the problem is among the hardest problems in NP, and if a polynomial-time algorithm exists for solving it, 
then polynomial-time algorithms exist for solving all problems in NP (which is unlikely, though not proven impossible).

The most common technique for proving that a problem is NP-complete is by reduction: you take a known NP-complete problem 
and show that you can transform its instances into instances of your problem in polynomial time while preserving the solution. 
If you can achieve this reduction, your problem inherits the NP-completeness of the original problem.

Conversely, to show that a problem is not NP-complete, you either need to demonstrate that it's not in NP or that it's not NP-hard. 
If a problem is not in NP, it cannot be NP-complete, and if it's not NP-hard, it cannot be as hard as the hardest problems in NP.
