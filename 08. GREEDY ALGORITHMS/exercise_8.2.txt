To maximize the point total during your seven-day stay in Europe, 
you can use a greedy strategy that prioritizes visiting attractions with the highest point values 
while ensuring that you have enough time each day to cover the attractions you plan to visit. 
Here's a possible greedy strategy:

    Sort the attractions by their point values in descending order.
    Start with an empty schedule for each day of your trip.
    Iterate through the sorted list of attractions:
    a. For each attraction, check if there is enough time remaining in any of the days of your trip to visit it.
    b. If there is enough time, schedule the attraction for that day and deduct the estimated time from the remaining time for that day.
    c. Continue until all attractions have been considered or there is no time left in any of the days.
    Repeat this process for each day of your trip.

This greedy strategy prioritizes visiting attractions with higher point values, 
ensuring that you maximize the total points accumulated during your trip.

However, it's important to note that this greedy strategy may not always provide the optimal solution. 
There might be cases where a different arrangement of attractions could result in a higher total point value. 
For example, some attractions might have shorter estimated times but still have high point values, 
allowing you to fit in more attractions within a day.

To determine whether the greedy strategy gives the optimal solution, you would need to compare the result obtained with other approaches, 
such as dynamic programming or exhaustive search, which consider all possible combinations of attractions to find the optimal solution. 
Additionally, practical constraints such as transportation logistics and opening hours of attractions should also be 
considered in real-world scenarios.
