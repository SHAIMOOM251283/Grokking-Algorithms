The problem you've described is known as the Set Cover Problem, which is indeed a well-known NP-hard problem. 
It's a classic problem in computer science and optimization theory.

While finding the optimal solution for the Set Cover Problem is computationally infeasible for large datasets due to its exponential time complexity, 
there are approximation algorithms and heuristic approaches that can provide near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time. 
Here are a few approaches you can consider:

    Greedy Algorithm: You can use a greedy algorithm to iteratively select the station that covers the most uncovered states 
    until all states are covered. 
    This approach doesn't guarantee the optimal solution, but it often provides a reasonably good solution in practice.

    Local Search Heuristics: Techniques like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms can be employed to iteratively improve a given solution 
    by making small changes and evaluating if the change leads to better coverage.

    Clustering: You can cluster stations based on their coverage areas and then select one station from each cluster 
    to cover different regions of the country. This approach can reduce the number of stations needed while still providing decent coverage.

    Integer Linear Programming (ILP): Although ILP formulations can find the optimal solution, 
    they might not be practical for very large datasets. However, for moderately sized instances, 
    modern solvers can often find good solutions within a reasonable amount of time.

    Approximation Algorithms: There exist polynomial-time approximation algorithms that 
    provide solutions guaranteed to be within a certain factor of the optimal solution. 
    One such algorithm is the greedy approximation algorithm, which has a performance guarantee of ln(n), where n is the number of states.

    Metaheuristic Approaches: Metaheuristic algorithms like ant colony optimization, tabu search, 
    or particle swarm optimization can be adapted to tackle the set cover problem efficiently.

When dealing with large datasets, a combination of these approaches or a tailored algorithmic solution might be necessary 
to find a satisfactory solution within a reasonable timeframe.
