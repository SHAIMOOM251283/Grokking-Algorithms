In dynamic programming, particularly when solving problems using techniques like memoization or tabulation, 
the order of rows can indeed be changed without affecting the correctness of the solution. 
This is because dynamic programming relies on solving subproblems and storing their solutions in a table, 
which can be filled in any order as long as the dependencies between subproblems are properly handled.

For example, consider the typical dynamic programming approach to solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem using tabulation. 
The solution involves filling in a table where each cell represents the maximum value that can be achieved with a certain number of items 
and a certain weight capacity of the knapsack. The order in which you iterate over the rows (representing the number of items) 
doesn't affect the final solution as long as you correctly compute the values for each cell based on previously computed values.

Similarly, in other dynamic programming problems, the order of rows can be changed without affecting the correctness of the solution, 
as long as the dependencies between subproblems are properly managed. 
This flexibility in the order of computation is one of the advantages of dynamic programming, 
as it allows for optimization and efficiency improvements in algorithm implementations.
