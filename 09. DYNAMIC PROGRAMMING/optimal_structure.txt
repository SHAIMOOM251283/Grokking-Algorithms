The issue here lies in the nature of dynamic programming and its assumption of "optimal substructure."

Dynamic programming works effectively when the problem can be broken down into overlapping subproblems, 
and the solution to each subproblem depends only on the solutions of its smaller subproblems. 
In other words, the optimal solution to the entire problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions to its subproblems.

However, in this scenario, the time required for each attraction in Paris is not independent of each other due to the travel time 
between London and Paris. When you select an attraction in Paris (let's say the Eiffel Tower), 
it affects the time available for visiting other attractions (such as the Louvre and Notre Dame) due to the reduced travel time needed 
for subsequent attractions.

This interdependence among subproblems violates the assumption of independent subproblems required for dynamic programming. 
As a result, the dynamic programming approach cannot accurately model this scenario.

In situations like this where the subproblems are not independent, 
other techniques such as greedy algorithms or backtracking may be more appropriate for finding an optimal solution. 
These techniques allow for considering the dependencies between subproblems and adjusting the solution accordingly.
