In the context of dynamic programming for the knapsack problem, 
the value of a column (or cell) in the dynamic programming table will never go down as the algorithm progresses. 
This is because the goal of dynamic programming is to find the optimal solution by considering all possible subproblems 
and storing their solutions in a table.

The key idea behind dynamic programming is that once we compute the value of a subproblem, 
we store it in a table so that we can reuse it when solving other subproblems. 
The value computed for a particular subproblem represents the best solution found so far considering the items processed up to that point.

In the knapsack problem specifically, the value of each cell in the dynamic programming table 
represents the maximum value that can be achieved with a certain number of items 
and a certain weight capacity of the knapsack. 
As the algorithm progresses, it iteratively computes the optimal value for each subproblem by considering whether to include the current item 
or not.

Since dynamic programming systematically explores all possible combinations of items and weight capacities, 
and since it only updates a cell in the table if a better solution is found, 
the value of a column (or cell) will never decrease as the algorithm progresses. 
Instead, it either stays the same or increases as better solutions are discovered.
