Phonebook with names and phone numbers:

    Hash function (a) returns "1" for all inputs, meaning all names would be hashed to the same index, resulting in a poor distribution.
    Hash function (b) uses the length of the string as the index. Since the names have different lengths, 
    it would provide a decent distribution.
    Hash function (c) uses the first character of the string as the index. Since the names start with different letters, 
    it would provide a decent distribution.
    Hash function (d) maps letters to primes and sums them up modulo the size of the hash. 
    This would likely provide a good distribution since it takes into account the entire string.

Conclusion: Hash functions (b), (c), and (d) would provide good distributions for the phonebook.

Mapping from battery size to power:

    Hash function (a) would hash all battery sizes to the same index, leading to a poor distribution.
    Hash function (b) uses the length of the string as the index. Since battery sizes have different lengths, 
    it would provide a decent distribution.
    Hash function (c) uses the first character of the string as the index. 
    This would not provide a good distribution as all battery sizes start with the letter "A".
    Hash function (d) maps letters to primes and sums them up modulo the size of the hash. 
    This would likely provide a good distribution since it takes into account the entire string.

Conclusion: Hash functions (b) and (d) would provide good distributions for the battery sizes.

Mapping from book titles to authors:

    Hash function (a) would hash all titles to the same index, leading to a poor distribution.
    Hash function (b) uses the length of the string as the index. Since book titles have different lengths, 
    it would provide a decent distribution.
    Hash function (c) uses the first character of the string as the index. 
    This may provide a decent distribution depending on the starting letters of the book titles.
    Hash function (d) maps letters to primes and sums them up modulo the size of the hash. 
    This would likely provide a good distribution since it takes into account the entire string.

Conclusion: Hash functions (b), (c), and (d) would provide good distributions for the book titles.

In summary, for each example:

    Phonebook: Hash functions (b), (c), and (d) are suitable.
    Battery size to power: Hash functions (b) and (d) are suitable.
    Book titles to authors: Hash functions (b), (c), and (d) are suitable.
