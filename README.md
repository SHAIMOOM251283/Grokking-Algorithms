# Grokking Algorithms: Python Implementation
This repository contains comprehensive Python implementations of all exercises and examples from "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava. Each chapter of the book corresponds to a directory in this repository, containing meticulously crafted code for the discussed algorithms. Not stopping at the prescribed exercises, I've enriched these implementations with variations and experiments, offering a deeper understanding and broader insights into algorithmic principles.

# About "Grokking Algorithms"

# Usage
Browse through the directories to find the Python scripts for each algorithm. 
To run the code, simply clone the repository to local machine and execute the Python scripts using Python interpreter.
For certain chapters, there are virtual environments (venv) included in the folders. If present, it's recommended to activate the virtual environment before running the code to ensure compatibility and dependency management. 
Then, proceed to run the Python scripts as usual.
