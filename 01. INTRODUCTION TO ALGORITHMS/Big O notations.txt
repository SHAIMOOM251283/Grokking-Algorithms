    You have a name, and you want to find the person’s phone number in the phone book.
        Suitable Big O: O(log n) - Logarithmic Time Complexity
        Explanation: If the phone book is sorted by name, you could use a binary search to efficiently find the person's phone number.

    You have a phone number, and you want to find the person’s name in the phone book.
        Suitable Big O: O(n) - Linear Time Complexity
        Explanation: In this case, you might need to scan through the phone book sequentially until you find the matching phone number.

    You want to read the numbers of every person in the phone book.
        Suitable Big O: O(n) - Linear Time Complexity
        Explanation: Reading the numbers of every person would require iterating through the entire phone book.

    You want to read the numbers of just the As.
        Suitable Big O: O(k) - Where 'k' is the number of entries that start with 'A'.
        Explanation: If the phone book is organized in a way that allows you to efficiently access entries starting with 'A' 
        (like a sorted list or a hash table with appropriate hashing), 
        the time complexity would depend on the number of entries with names starting with 'A'.
