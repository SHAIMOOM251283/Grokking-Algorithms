# print_items function

print_items(list):
    for each item in list:    // Iterate through each item in the list
        print(item)           // Perform a constant-time operation: printing the item

Time Complexity: O(n)

Explanation: The code iterates through each item in the list exactly once and performs a constant-time operation (printing) for each item. 
Therefore, the time complexity is linear, O(n), where n is the number of items in the list.

# print_items2 function

print_items2(list):
    for each item in list:    // Iterate through each item in the list
        sleep(1)              // Sleep for a constant duration of 1 second
        print(item)           // Perform a constant-time operation: printing the item

Time Complexity: O(n)

Explanation: Although the code introduces a sleep operation, which pauses for 1 second for each item in the list, this does not affect the time complexity. 
The time complexity remains linear, O(n), where n is the number of items in the list. 
This is because the sleep operation is constant for each iteration and does not depend on the size of the input list. 
Therefore, the overall time complexity is still O(n).
