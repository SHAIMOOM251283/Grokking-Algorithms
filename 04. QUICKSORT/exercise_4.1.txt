# SUM FUNCTION WITH RECURSION

    The function starts with the list [1, 2, 3, 4].
    It adds the first element (1) to the result of calling recursive_sum with the rest of the list ([2, 3, 4]).
    Now, the function is called recursively with the list [2, 3, 4].
    Again, it adds the first element (2) to the result of calling recursive_sum with the rest of the list ([3, 4]).
    Then, it adds the first element (3) to the result of calling recursive_sum with the rest of the list ([4]).
    Finally, when the function is called with the list containing only one element ([4]), it returns 4.
    Now, the function returns the result of adding the first element (3) to the sum obtained in the previous step (4), which is 7.
    The function returns the result of adding the first element (2) to the sum obtained in the previous step (7), which is 9.
    The function returns the result of adding the first element (1) to the sum obtained in the previous step (9), which is 10.
    The final result, which is the sum of all elements in the original list [1, 2, 3, 4], is 10.

Step 1: The initial list is [1, 2, 3, 4].

Step 2:

    The function adds the first element (1) to the result of calling recursive_sum with the rest of the list ([2, 3, 4]).
    This becomes 1 + ([2, 3, 4]).

Step 3:

    The function adds the first element (2) to the result of calling recursive_sum with the rest of the list ([3, 4]).
    This becomes 2 + ([3, 4]).

Step 4:

    The function adds the first element (3) to the result of calling recursive_sum with the rest of the list ([4]).
    This becomes 3 + ([4]).

Step 5:

    The function is called with the list containing only one element ([4]), and it returns 4.

Now, let's summarize the calculation:

Step 1: ([1, 2, 3, 4])
Step 2: 1 + ([2, 3, 4]) = 1 + 9 = 10
Step 3: 2 + ([3, 4]) = 2 + 7 = 9
Step 4: 3 + ([4]) = 3 + 4 = 7
Step 5: 4 + ([]) = 4

So, the final result is 10, as expected. 

The recursive_sum function takes a list of numbers as input.
It checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns 0 (base case).
If the list is not empty, the function recursively calls itself with the rest of the list (i.e., without the first element).
In each recursive call, the function adds the first element of the list to the sum obtained from the recursive call.
This process continues until the base case is reached (an empty list).
Once the base case is reached, the function starts returning values to its caller, 
adding the first element of the list to the sum obtained from the recursive call.

Step 1: The initial list is [1, 2, 3, 4].
Step 2: The function adds the first element (1) to the result of calling recursive_sum with the rest of the list ([2, 3, 4]). This becomes 1 + 9 = 10.
Steps 3, 4, and 5: The recursive calls continue until the base case is reached (an empty list). Once the base case is reached, the function returns a value to its caller, and this value is added to the previous result obtained from the recursive call.
Finally, the final result (10) is returned to the original caller.
